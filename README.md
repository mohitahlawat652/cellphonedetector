The cell phone detector has different ways of alerting the user of the phone; it does this by either sending an alert message, a single beep of the detector or ringtone.

This is a great way to prevent the use of cell phones in examination halls, worship sites, private rooms, etc. The use of the cell phone detector is also one of the ways of managing cell phones in the classroom.
